# Coding Lessons w/Riz


## Useful links
Whilst you're learning how to code in HTML, I strongly recommend the following resources:

### Text editors

There are loads of different text editors to choose from (even Notepad is ok!), but you should strongly consider choosing one of the following (in order):

* Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
  - Download here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
  - I strongly recommend using VSCode! I've used (and still use) all of these text editors, but in my experience VSCode is the best and fastest.
* Atom
  - Download here: https://atom.io/
  - Atom is a great text editor, and functions very similarly to VSCode. Atom will hold your hand less than VSCode, but will still provide you with a good experience.
* Notepad ++
  - Download here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/
  - This is more or less Notepad with colours and guidelines - avoid unless you're feeling brave!

### Learning resources

Whilst you're learing, check out the following links (but try to stay on target with learning HTML. It's very easy to get side-tracked, and it's important to learn the basics first):

* W3 Schools
  - Link: https://www.w3schools.com/html/
* MDN Web Docs
  - Link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

## GitHub

GitHub can look really complicated, but it's actually quite simple! Each version is labelled a 'branch', and within this GitHub repository, I will upload each coding lesson we go through.

In each lesson 'branch', I will include the example code (which you will be free to download and/or look at), and a 'README.md' file, which will detail everything we've gone through.

For example, in the top left, navigate to 'Branch: lesson-1', and you will be able to find an 'index.html' file containing the lesson's example code, as well as the 'README.md' file detailing the lesson's topics and areas covered.

If you're struggling to use GitHub, or find what you need, feel free to ask me questions!
